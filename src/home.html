    The --mode development is what’s called a flag or option. We haven’t talked about this, but it essentially instructs Webpack that you are in development mode. We can also pass in --mode production which we will do when we build our project. These aren’t necessarily required for Webpack to work. Without these, you will get a warning message telling you to provide a mode when you run Webpack
